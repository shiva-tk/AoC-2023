# AoC-2023
My solutions for Advent of Code 2023.

## Solutions
For each day, there is a separate folder, containing the code for the solution to that day's puzzle. The solution to both 
parts are usually found in the same file.

## Running
Navigate to the folder corresponding the relevant day's solution. Run:

```
runghc main.hs <part_number>
```

where `part_number` is either 1 or 2.
